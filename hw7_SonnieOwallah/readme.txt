Project Title: HW7: Ensemble approaches
Author: Sonnie Owallah
Date: 04/11/2025

Description:
This report presents the classification performance of several ensemble learning approaches on two distinct datasets: the digits dataset from scikit-learn and the Mammographic Mass Data Set from the UCI repository.

System and Software Requirements:
1. Python version 3.10 or higher.
2. Scikit-learn library
3. NumPy library
4. Pandas library
5. Matplotlib library
6. UCI repository
 

Files Included:
1. A zip file named hw7_sonnieowallah which has the following files. 
2. readme.txt:  a file with detailed instructions on how to run the Python program. 
3. index.py: The Python script to execute the program.
4. main.py 
5. report.pdf
6. mammographic_mass_data.csv:  for use in case of connection errors to UCI server

Steps to Run the Program:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher. You can do this by opening your command prompt/terminal and running  python --version. If you do not have Python or need to update the version, visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install the Scikit-learn library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install scikit-learn.
3. Install the NumPy library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install numpy.
4. Install the Pandas library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install pandas.

5. Install the Matplotlib library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install matplotlib.
6. Extract the files in the zip file and save them in an unzipped directory/folder.
7. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory.
8. To run the program from the command prompt/ terminal, open your command prompt/ terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files.
9. Execute the following commands:    
	python index.py – for Task 1
	python main.py – for Task 2


Expected Output:
1. Text output
* Data shape 
* Accuracy Score
* Training Time (seconds)
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

2. Generated plots 
* ROC Curve and AUC plots (binary classification only) 

Troubleshooting: 
- If the script fails to execute, ensure the Python version is 3.10 or higher, the required packages are installed, and verify the path for the dataset is correct.
