Project Title: HW5: Compare Regression Methods
Author: Sonnie Owallah
Date: 03/04/2025

Description:
This report analyzes the application of Linear Regression, RANSAC Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet and Random Forest regression techniques, on the California housing dataset. The performance of these models was evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), R2 score, and training time. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to assess its impact on model performance, and residual plots were used to analyze the distribution of errors.

System and Software Requirements:
1. Python version 3.10 or higher.
2. Pandas library
3. Matplotlib library
4. Seaborn library
5. Scikit-learn library

Files Included:
1. A zip file named hw5_sonnieowallah which has the following files.
2. readme.txt - a file with detailed instructions on how to run the Python program.
3. index.py: The Python script to execute the program.
4. report.pdf

Steps to Run the Program:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher. You can do this by opening your command prompt/terminal and running  python --version. If you do not have Python or need to update the version, visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install the Pandas library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install pandas .
3. Install the Matplotlib library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install matplotlib .
4. Install the Seaborn library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install Seaborn.
5. Install the Scikit-learn library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install scikit-learn.
6. Extract the files in the zip file and save them in an unzipped directory/folder.
7. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory.
8. To run the program from the command prompt/ terminal, open your command prompt/ terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files.
9. Execute the following commands:    python index.py


Expected Output:
1. Text output
* Data head 
* Data shape
* Columns missing values 
* Mean squared errors (MSE)
* R2 Scores
* Training Time

2. Generated plots 
* Effect of Alpha on MSE
* Effect of Alpha on R2 Score 
* Training and testing residual plots
* Pairplot showing correlations between different features in the dataset

Troubleshooting: 
- If the script fails to execute, ensure the Python version is 3.10 or higher, the required packages are installed, and verify the path for the dataset is correct.
