Project Title: HW1: Basic Python Programming

Description: 
This Python program loads and analyzes the Iris dataset, visualizes the relationships between two columns of the data and creates a scatter plot that uses different markers for each unique value in the last column to provide a clear visualization of the dataset's features.

System and Software Requirements:
1) Python version 3.10 or higher.
2) Pandas library
3) Matplotlib library

Files Included:
A zip file named hw1_sonnieowallah which has the following files.
1) readme.txt - a file with detailed instructions to run the Python program.
2) index.py - python script
3) iris.data - Iris dataset
4) iris.names - Iris dataset description

Steps to Run the Program:
1) Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher. You can do this by opening your command prompt/terminal and running ‘py -3 –version’. If you do not have Python or need to update the version, visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2) Install the Pandas library from the command prompt/terminal using ‘pip install pandas’.
3) Install the Matplotlib library from the command prompt/terminal using ‘pip install matplotlib’.
4) Extract the files in the zip file and save them in an unzipped directory/folder. 
5) Ensure that the directory contains the dataset ‘iris.data’ and the Python script ‘index.py’, these 2 files must be in the same directory.
6) To run the program from the command prompt/ terminal, open your command prompt/ terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Python script ‘index.py’ and ‘iris.data’ dataset. 
7) Execute the command ‘python index.py’.
8) If using VSCode to run this program, open the directory containing the dataset ‘iris.data’ and the Python script ‘index.py’ in VSCode. 
9) Click on the ‘index.py’ file to open.
10) Right-click on the ‘index.py’ file and select “Run python file in terminal.”

Expected Output:
1) Text output that shows the first few rows to preview the data, prints the total number of rows and columns and lists the last column's distinct values. It also provides basic statistics for "Iris-setosa," such as the average of the first column, the maximum value of the second column, and the minimum value of the third column.
2) Scatter Plot that maps the values of the first column on the x-axis and the second column on the y-axis. Each distinct value of the last column is represented using a unique marker. 

Troubleshooting: 
- If the script fails to execute, ensure the Python version is 3.10 or higher, the required packages are installed, and verify the path for the dataset is correct.
