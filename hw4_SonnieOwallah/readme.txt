Project Title: HW3: Dimensionality reduction techniques
Author: Sonnie Owallah
Date: 02/27/2025

Description:
This report analyzes the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Kernel PCA (KPCA) for dimensionality reduction on the Iris and MNIST datasets. The performance of these techniques was evaluated by feeding the reduced data into a decision tree classifier, calculating accuracy, execution time , explained variance ration and running classification report.

System and Software Requirements:
1. Python version 3.10 or higher.
2. Numpy library
3. Matplotlib library
4. Scikit-learn library

Files Included:
1. A zip file named hw4_sonnieowallah which has the following files.
2. readme.txt - a file with detailed instructions on how to run the Python program.
3. index.py: The Python script to execute the program.
4. report.pdf

Steps to Run the Program:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher. You can do this by opening your command prompt/terminal and running  python --version. If you do not have Python or need to update the version, visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install the Numpy library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install pandas .
3. Install the Matplotlib library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install matplotlib .
4. Install the Scikit-learn library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install scikit-learn.
5. Extract the files in the zip file and save them in an unzipped directory/folder.
6. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory.
7. To run the program from the command prompt/ terminal, open your command prompt/ terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files.
8. Execute the following commands:    python index.py


Expected Output:
1. Text output
* Data Shape 
* Explained variance ratio
* Execution times
* Accuracy scores
* Classification reports

2. Generated plots 
* PCA - Explained variance ratio Vs Principal components
* LDA projection
* Kernel PCA projection
* Kernel PCA Projection(make moons dataset)

Troubleshooting: 
- If the script fails to execute, ensure the Python version is 3.10 or higher, the required packages are installed, and verify the path for the dataset is correct.
