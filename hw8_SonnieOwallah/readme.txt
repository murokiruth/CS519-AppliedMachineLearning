Description:
This report presents a CNN architecture design, which we implement using PyTorch. We examine the CNN model's performance on the MNIST dataset. The evaluation metrics we measure are accuracy score, training time, and epoch-to-epoch improvement rate. 

System and Software Requirements: 
1. Python version 3.10 or higher
2. PyTorch library 
3. Matplotlib library 
4. NumPy 


Files Included: 
1. A zip file named hw8_sonnieowallah which has the following files:  
2. readme.txt: a file with detailed instructions on how to run the Python program. 
3. index.py: the Python script to execute the program. 
4. report.pdf 
5. CNN_architecture_design.png – the CNN Architecture Design I drew.
6. MNIST dataset folder

Steps to Run the Program:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher. You can do this by opening your command prompt/terminal and running  python --version. If you do not have Python or need to update the version, visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/. 
2. Install the PyTorch library from the command prompt/terminal using pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
3. Install the Matplotlib library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install matplotlib. 
4. Install the NumPy library from the command prompt/terminal using  pip install numpy. 
5. Extract the files in the zip file and save them in an unzipped directory/folder. 
6. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory. 
7. To run the program from the command prompt/ terminal, open your command prompt/ terminal and navigate to the directory containing the files. 
8. Execute the following commands:    python index.py 


Expected Output: 
1. Text output 
* Data shape 
* Accuracy Scores
* Training Time

2. Generated plots  
* Accuracy graph plot
* Loss graph plot
* Predicted labels plot

Troubleshooting:
- If the script fails to execute, ensure the Python version is 3.10 or higher,  PyTorch is installed, all other required packages are installed, and verify the path for the dataset is correct.
